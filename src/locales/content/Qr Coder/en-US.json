  "motivationText": "On older smartphone models, it was not possible to scan a QR code natively by the camera, so users had to install an app just for that, which was my case. Instead of downloading an app for this purpose, I decided to develop my own QR code scanner, with the aim of expanding my Android app development skills, as well as making it public to a large part of the world."
